Simple readme.txt for iDistance indexing program
------------------------------------

Compile using: make

Must run from within the "run" folder as:
./iDist {-C "configfile"} {-SS}
        [-B "datasetfile" | -L "treefile"] 
	{-QP "qfile" | -QR "qfile" | -QN "qfile" kval}

Which is essentially:

1. An optional config file to load implementation options
  -C "config file name" : sets the given parameters from file

2. An optional flag for peforming Sequential Search, instead of iDistance.
  -SS : if present, run queries with sequential search

3. Followed by a required b+tree choice:
  -B "dataset file name" : builds b+tree from dataset
  -L "b+tree file name"  : loads b+tree from file

4. Followed by an optional query choice:
  -QP "point file name"   : runs a point query on given point
  -QR "range file name"   : runs a range query on given range
  -QN "point file name" k : runs a kNN query at given point

If the config file is not given, the default parameter options are used. 
The "-SS" parameter must appear before any query flag. Also note that 
you can build the tree without executing a query, since this 
automatically saves the tree to be loaded later.

example:
./iDist -C "settings.conf" -B "uniform_16_1000.txt"
./iDist -L "uniform_16_1000.tree" -QP "qpfile.txt"
./iDist -SS -L "uniform_16_1000.tree" -QP "qpfile.txt"

All program output will be in the high level "results" folder. Different program run options produce different types of output files. All program output (including results) is also appended to a single "status.txt" file. All program run statistics are compactly stored in a CSV "stats.text" file.

Run specific output files:
1. Tree Build (-B) results : "dataset file name".results
2. Tree Save (-B) files : "dataset file name".tree, "dataset file name".data
3. Query results : "query file name".results
4. If Sequential Search : "query file name"_ss.results
