This folder contains a configuration file, data file, and query files to test
the iDistance algorithm in a 2D space-based partitioning environment. This is the
same as shown in examples in papers, slides, and presentations.

Run as:
./iDist -C ../test/2D/test.conf -B test/2D/test_2_10.txt {query}

Where {query} is one of the following:

-QP test/test_2_10_qp.txt
 same as the data file, tests that you find each given point.

-QR test/test_2_10_qr.txt
 two range queries: 
   1) 7,8,9 
   2) 1,4,5,6

-QN test/test_2_10_qn.txt
 two knn queries:
   run with k=3 and get 1) 7,8,9
   run with k=10 and get 2) all the points in order: 3,2,4,1,7,0,5,8,6,9

Optionally you can also run the example script with two different example runs as:
sh ../test/2D/runScript.sh
